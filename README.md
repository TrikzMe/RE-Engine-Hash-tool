# RE-Engine-Hash-tool
A tool inspirated by Scobalula to generate hashes of filenames for RE Engine games.
Generate the needed hashes to unpack RE Engine .PAK archives.
  Compatible:
    - Devil May Cry 5
    - RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2
    - RESIDENT EVIL 3

How to use:
  Drag and drop the file that contains the filenames over the .EXE
  A new file called "re3_pak_names_release.list" will be created then use this .LIST to unpack .PAK with game filenames.


Dependencies:
  Normally everything is from "RE Engine Hash generator.dll" but if problems,
  You'll need:
    - MurMur3.dll
